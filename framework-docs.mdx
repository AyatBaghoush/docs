Here is the documentation for the SuperTest + Cucumber test framework in Markdown format:

# Framework Overview

SuperTest is a Node.js library that makes it easy to test HTTP requests across multiple environments. Your tests can make assertions and run requests against a variety of servers by using a simple and expressive interface so you can easily simulate a user's actions.

Cucumber is a testing framework that supports Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) testing practices. With this framework, developers can write tests that document the behavior of the code and illustrate the desired outcomes. 

This documentation will provide details on how to configure and run tests within this framework. 

# Setup Instructions

To set up the testing environment, ensure the following dependencies are installed:
- Node.js
- Cucumber
- Chai

Install the required dependencies for the project by running the following command in the terminal:
```shell
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber@10 @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-jest supertest
```

## Setting Up Dependencies

First, create a directory called `step-definitions` and within that folder, create three new files called `common-steps.js`, `create-user-steps.js`, and `fetch-users-steps.js`. 

## Configure Step Definitions

In the `step-definitions` folder, each `.js` file will contain steps for a different feature or scenario. 

In `common-steps.js`, the `Given`, `When`, `Then`, and `setDefaultTimeout` clauses define steps that are reused across scenarios. The code sets the default timeout for all steps to 20 seconds. 

In `create-user-steps.js`, the `When` step defines a function that returns a user object with a missing password field, and the `Then` step defines a function that checks if the returned error message contains a specific error string. 

In `fetch-users-steps.js`, the `When` step defines a function that retrieves a list of users from the endpoint, and the `Then` step defines a function that checks if the response contains an empty user array. 

## Writing Test Scenarios

In this example, there is a `features` folder which contains feature files written in Gherkin syntax. Each feature file contains a set of scenarios that can be executed by the Cucumber testing framework. 

Within this folder, create a file called `schema-validation.feature` and edit it with the following code:

```gherkin
# Schema Validation Feature

Feature: Schema Validation

    Scenario: Validating response against JSON schema
        Given The "users" service is available
        When I retrieve the list of users
        Then Response should contain list of users
        And Response should match JSON schema "users.schema.json"
```

This code defines a scenario for the feature file that checks that a list of users is returned and that the response matches the `users.schema.json` schema.

## Configure and Run Tests

Finally, run the following command in the terminal to configure and run the tests:

```shell
cucumber-js --require biomarkers --require @babel/core --require @babel/preset-env --require ./step-definitions --plugin json:./reports/cucumber-report.json features
```

This command runs the Cucumber testing framework, with the require modules, step definitions, and plugins. 

# Test Scenarios Description

## Schema Validation Feature

This feature validates that the response from the API matches a JSON schema definition. It retrieves a list of users and checks that the response contains an array of users and that the schema of the response matches the defined schema. 

# Utilities and Helpers

## Logger

The logger utility logs messages to the console, which can be useful for debugging. 

## Test Data Manager

The test data manager is a helper utility that provides test data for various test scenarios. In this framework, it is used to provide sample user data for the create user scenario. 

## Schema Validator

The schema validator is a helper utility used to validate the response data against a JSON schema. 

# How to Run the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```shell
cucumber-js --require biomarkers --require @babel/core --require @babel/preset-env --require ./step-definitions --plugin json:./reports/cucumber-report.json features
```

This command runs the Cucumber testing framework, with the required modules, step definitions, and plugins. 

Any notes or best practices will be documented here.

# Other Notes

Use biomarkers to declare the steps of your scenarios in a more readable and structured way.

You can also use the plugin option in the cucumber-js CLI to generate a report of the tests, like this:

```shell
--plugin json:./reports/cucumber-report.json
```

This will generate a report in JSON format that can be used to analyze the test results. 

You can also use the `--require` option to require other modules needed for your tests. This is how the `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env`, and babel-jest modules are required in the previous example.
