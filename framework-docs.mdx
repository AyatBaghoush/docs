Here is the documentation for the SuperTest + Cucumber test framework in Markdown format:

# Framework Overview

SuperTest is a Node.js library that makes it easy to test HTTP requests across multiple environments. Your tests can make requests with different HTTP methods, specify headers, payloads, and route URLs, and specify their expected behavior -- all with plain English descriptions and intuitive syntax.

Cucumber is a testing framework that allows developers to write tests in a format that non-technical business stakeholders can easily understand. These tests are called "behavioral tests" or "scenario tests," as they describe the behavior of the system being tested. In Cucumber, steps are written in a natural language that defines the scene or scenario that the step represents.

This framework combines the power of SuperTest and Cucumber, leveraging the best of both worlds to provide a robust and intuitive testing solution for HTTP requests. 

## Features

The framework boasts several features that enhance test efficiency and clarity:

- Intuitive syntax for tests that closely mirrors natural language, making tests easier to read and maintain.
- Detailed error messages and debug logs, which enhance the diagnostic resolution of test failures.
- Test data managers provide a wide range of test data for various test scenarios, ensuring test coverage and reducing maintenance overhead.
- Flexible and reusable step definitions facilitate the creation of reusable steps that can be shared across scenarios. These steps can be customized with specific implementations to cater to various scenarios.
- Default timeouts ensure that tests are not indefinitely pending while waiting for responses, and the ability to set custom timeouts allows for more control over test execution. 

## Test Scenario Description

The following scenarios are defined for the framework:

## Setup Instructions

To run the tests, you must install the dependencies and set up the framework. 

1. Install the required Node.js dependencies:
```
npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber@10.0.0 chai @cucumber/chai @types/chai @cucumber/webpack-loader @types/webpack-loader
```
2. Add the script to run the Cucumber tests to `package.json`:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "cucumber-js"
}
```
3. Create a JavaScript file to set up the Cucumber configuration, including step definitions and support code. For example, you can create a file called `functional-tests/lib/cucumber-steps.js` and define the steps there. 
4. Write feature files (e.g., `functional-tests/features/create-user.feature`) to define the test scenarios and steps using the syntax and conventions of Cucumber. Provide clear and concise descriptions of each step and its expected outcome. 

## Utilities and Helpers

The framework provides several utility functions and helpers to simplify test execution and management:

- **`getLogger()`**: This function retrieves or creates a logger instance based on the provided namespace. Logger instances are used to log messages to the console, capturing information about the flow and errors throughout the test execution.
- **`testDataManager`**: This object is a collection of utility methods to retrieve test data. It provides data for various test scenarios, ensuring the availability of diverse test cases. 
- **`schemaValidator`**: This object is a utility function that validates JSON against a schema using the AJV validator. It's used to ensure that the response from the API matches the expected schema. 

## How to Run the Tests

To run the tests, use the following command in the terminal:

```
cucumber-js
```

This will execute the test scenarios defined in the feature files. You can also use the `--glue` flag to execute steps in external step definition files.

## Best Practices and Notes

- When writing step definitions, try to keep them concise and focused on a specific task. 
- The framework uses Mocha and should ideally be paired with a comprehensive assertion library such as Chai or Should.js. 
- It's best to keep your feature files clean and free of syntax errors. Use inline comments to improve readability and maintainability, and ensure feature files are stored in a version-controlled repository. 
- For debugging purposes, the framework logs error messages and debug information when running the tests. Make sure you check the console for any relevant logs if a test fails. 
- Utilize the framework's built-in timeout mechanism to ensure that tests are not hanging indefinitely, improving the overall stability of your test execution.
